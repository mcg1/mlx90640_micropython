# mlx90640 driver for micro-python
Fully micro-python reworking of the Adafruit MLX90640 driver.

Original CPP source at https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MLX90640/tree/master

Tested on Raspbery Pi Pico W using Pimoroni 'Cosmic Unicorn' LED panel.

Gets about 2 or 3 FPS, but theres still some improvements to be made.
